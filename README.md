# Project-Mindex

# This project was created for Mindex by Michael Leib

# There may be issues with running the code using python-dotenv to substitue the key values for whomever is testing the script, 
# it would be easiest to input their own keys for the Mindex AWS Server and comment out the two lines below:

# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv()
